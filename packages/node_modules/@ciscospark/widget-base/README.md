# Spark Space Widget _(@ciscospark/widget-base)_

> This base React component does the initial React, Spark authentication, and Redux setup for all Spark widgets.

## Usage

### Quick Start

To automatically connect reducers into a Redux store, setup Cisco Spark connections, and register your widget into the global browser store, you can call the `constructSparkWidget` method like so:

``` js
import constructSparkWidget from `@ciscospark/widget-base`;

function MyWidget(props) {
  return <div>My Widget</div>;
}

const MyWidgetWithSpark = constructSparkWidget(`nameOfMyWidget`, MyWidget, {
  intl: {
    messages: null, // react-intl messages object
    locale: `en` // locale for react-intl
  },
  browserGlobals: true, // if you would like to inject the widget into browser globals
  dataAPI: true, // if you would like the widget to use dataAPIs to inject onto the page
  reducers: {} // Any reducers you would like to include in the Redux store
});
```

By constructing the widget like so you will have access to any Spark redux modules you've passed into the `constructSparkWidget` options, as well as a `spark` instance that can be used to interface with Cisco Spark services. For more details on how to take advantage of each, take a look at the `widget-message-meet` package, or any of the `redux-module-` packages in this repo.
