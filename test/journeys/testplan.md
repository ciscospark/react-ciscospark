# Test Plan

The Webex Teams Widgets have full integration (or "journey") tests performed to validate proper behavior.

The widgets are tested via [Webdriver.io](https://webdriver.io) using devices powered by [Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com).

Every code change pull request (PR) is tested and verified by [Circle CI](https://circleci.com) by running the smoke test suite on the supported browsers/operating systems. Before a PR is opened, it is the responsibility of the developer to run the full suite on the widget that has changes.

## Test Suites

- Smoke Test
- Space Widget
- Recents

### Smoke Test Suite

The smoke test suite verifies basic functionality of all widgets. This suite is used for both TAP (tests against production) tests and validated merge (run on circle ci or Jenkins) builds.
